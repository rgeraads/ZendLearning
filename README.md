# How to start

Clone the project

    git clone git@github.com:verschoof/ZendLearning.git zend-learning 

Copy the `data/config.yml.dist` to `data/config.yml.dist`.

Run `php -S localhost:8080` in 'public' directory and go to `http://localhost:8080`

# ToDo

- In the `data/questsion.yml` are still a lot of questions that doesn't have any link.
- The links only support php manual links, there are now a few links that go to other websites then php.net
